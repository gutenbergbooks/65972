<h2 class="nobreak"><em>To my Worthy and Learned Friend,<br />
Dr.</em> Walter Pope, <em>late Proctor of<br />
the University of</em> Oxford.</h2>

<p class="gesperrtx"><em>SIR</em>,</p>

<p class="drop-capy">I Know not what pleasure you could take in bestowing
your commands so unprofitably, unless it be that for
which Nature sometimes cherishes and allows Monsters,
The love of Variety. This onely delight you will receive
by turning over this rude and unpolisht Copy, and
comparing it with my excellent Patterns, the <em>Greek</em> and
<em>Latin</em>. By this you will see how much a noble Subject is
chang’d and disfigured by an ill hand, and what reason
<em>Alexander</em> had to forbid his Picture to be drawn but by
some celebrated Pencil. In <em>Greek Thucydides</em> so well and so
lively expresses it, that I know not which is more a Poem,
his description, or that of <em>Lucretius</em>. Though it must be
said, that the <em>Historian</em> had a vast advantage over the <em>Poet</em>;
He having been present on the place, and assaulted by the
disease himself, had the horror familiar to his Eyes, and all
the shapes of the <em>misery</em> still remaining on his mind, which
must needs make a great impression on his Pen and Fancie.
Whereas the <em>Poet</em> was forced to allow his foot-steps,
and onely work on that matter he allow’d him. This I
speak, because it may in some measure too excuse my own
defects: For being so far remov’d from the place whereon
the disease acted its Tragedy; and time having denied
us many of the circumstances, customes of the Countrey,
and other small things which would be of great use to any
one who did intend to be perfect on the subject; besides
onely writing by an <em>Idea</em> of that which I never yet
saw, nor care to feel, (being not of the humor of the Painter
in Sir <em>Philip Sidney</em>, who thrust himself into the midst
of a Fight, that he might the better delineate it) having, I
say, all these disadvantages, and many more, for which I
must onely blame my self, it cannot be expected, that I
should come near equalling him in whom none of the
contrary advantages were wanting. Thus then, Sir, by
emboldning me to this rash attempt, you have given opportunitie
to the <em>Greek</em> and <em>Latin</em> to Triumph over our
<em>Mother tongue</em>. Yet I would not have the honour of the
Countries or Languages engaged in the comparison, but
that the inequality should reach no farther than the Authors.
But I have much reason to fear the just indignation
of that excellent Person, (the present Ornament and
Honour of our Nation) whose way of writing I imitate:
for he may think himself as much injured by my following
him, as were the Heavens by that bold mans counterfeiting
the sacred and unimitable noise of Thunder by the
sound of Brass and Horses hoofs. I shall onely say for my
self, that I took <em>Cicero</em>’s advice, who bids us in imitation
propose the Noblest pattern to our thoughts; for so we
may be sure to be raised above the common Level, though
we come infinitely short of what we aim at. Yet I hope
that renowned Poet will have none of my crimes any
way reflect on himself; for it was not any fault in the
excellent Musician, that the weak Bird, indeavouring by
straining its throat, to follow his Notes, destroyed her self
in the Attempt. Well, Sir, by this, that I have chosen rather
to expose my self than be disobedient, you may guess
with what zeal and hazard I strive to approve my self,</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap gesperrt">Thucydides</span>, Lib. 2.</h2>

<p class="pfs120">As it is excellently Translated by Mr. <em>Hobbs</em>.</p>


<p class="drop-capz">I<em>n the very beginning of Summer, the</em> Peloponnesians, <em>and
their</em> Confederates, <em>with two thirds of their forces, as before
invaded</em> Attica, <em>under the conduct of</em> Archidamus, <em>the son
of</em> Zeuxidamas, <em>King of</em> Lacedæmon, <em>and after they had encamped
themselves, wasted the Countrey about them</em>.</p>

<p><em>They had not been many days in</em> Attica, <em>when the Plague first
began amongst the</em> Athenians, <em>said also to have seized formerly
on divers other parts, as about</em> Lemnos, <em>and elsewhere; but so
great a Plague, and Mortality of Men, was never remembred to
have hapned in any place before. For at first, neither were the
Physicians able to cure it, through ignorance of what it was, but
died fastest themselves, as being the men that most approach’d the
sick, nor any other art of man availed whatsoever. All supplications
to the</em> Gods, <em>and enquiries of</em> Oracles, <em>and whatsoever other
means they used of that kind, proved all unprofitable; insomuch
as subdued with the greatness of the evil, they gave
them all over. It began (by report) first, in that part of</em> Æthiopia
<em>that lieth upon</em> Ægypt, <em>and thence fell down into</em> Ægypt
<em>and</em> Afrique, <em>and into the greatest part of the Territories of
the</em> King. <em>It invaded</em> Athens <em>on a sudden, and touched first upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2p"></a>[p2]</span>
those that dwelt in</em> Pyræus, <em>insomuch as they reported that
the</em> Peloponnesians <em>had cast poyson into their Wells; for Springs
there were not any in that place. But afterwards it came up into
the high City, and then they died a great deal faster. Now let
every man, Physician, or other, concerning the ground of this
sickness, whence it sprung, and what causes he thinks able to produce
so great an alteration, speak according to his own knowledge;
for my own part, I will deliver but the manner of it, and lay
open onely such things, as one may take his Mark by, to discover
the same if it come again, having been both sick of it my self,
and seen others sick of the same. This year, by confession of all
men, was of all other, for other Diseases, most free and healthful.
If any man were sick before, his disease turned to this; if not, yet
suddenly, without any apparent cause preceding, and being in
perfect health, they were taken first with an extream ache in
their Heads, redness and inflamation of the Eyes; and then inwardly
their Throats and Tongues grew presently bloody, and
their breath noysome and unsavory. Upon this followed a sneezing
and hoarsness, and not long after, the pain, together with a
mighty cough, came down into the brest. And when once it was
setled in the Stomach, it caused vomit, and with great torment
came up all manner of bilious purgation that Physicians ever named.
Most of them had also the Hickeyexe, which brought with
it a strong Convulsion, and in some ceased quickly, but in others
was long before it gave over. Their bodies outwardly to the
touch, were neither very hot, nor pale, but reddish, livid, and beflowred
with little pimples and whelks; but so burned inwardly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3p"></a>[p3]</span>
as not to endure any the lightest cloaths or linnen garment to
be upon them, nor any thing but meer nakedness, but rather, most
willingly to have cast themselves into the cold water. And many
of them that were not looked to, possessed with insatiate thirst,
ran unto the Wells; and to drink much, or little, was indifferent,
being still from ease and power to sleep as far as ever. As long
as the disease was at the height, their bodies wasted not, but resisted
the torment beyond all expectation, insomuch as the most of
them either died of their inward burning in 9 or 7 dayes, whilest
they had yet strength, or if they escaped that, then the disease falling
down into their bellies, and causing there great exulcerations
and immoderate looseness, they died many of them afterwards
through weakness: For the disease (which took first the
head) began above, and came down, and passed through the
whole body; and he that overcame the worst of it, was yet marked
with the loss of his extreme parts; for breaking out both
at their Privy-members, and at their Fingers and Toes, many
with the loss of these escaped. There were also some that lost
there Eys, &amp; many that presently upon their recovery were taken
with such an oblivion of all things whatsoever, as they neither
knew themselves nor their acquaintance. For this was a kind of
sickness which far surmounted all expression of words, and both
exceeded Humane Nature, in the cruelty wherewith it handled
each one, and appeared also otherwise to be none of those diseases
that are bred amongst us, and that especially by this. For all, both
Birds and Beasts; that use to feed on Humane flesh, though many
men lay abroad unburied, either came not at them, or tasting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4p"></a>[p4]</span>
perished. An Argument whereof as touching the</em> Birds, <em>is the
manifest defect of such Fowl, which were not then seen, neither
about the Carcasses, or any where else; but by the Dogs, because
they are familiar with Men, this effect was seen much clearer.
So that this disease (to pass over many strange particulars of the
accidents that some had differently from others) was in general
such as</em> I <em>have shewn; and for other usual sicknesses, at that time,
no man was troubled with any. Now they died, some for want
of attendance, and some again with all the care and</em> Physick <em>that
could be used. Nor was there any, to say, certain Medicine, that
applied <ins class="corr" id="tn-4p" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'must hvve helped them'">
must have helped</ins> them; for if it did good to one, it did
harm to another; nor any difference of</em> Body <em>for strength or
weakness that was able to resist it; but it carried all away what
Physick soever was administred. But the greatest misery of all
was, the dejection of Mind, in such as found themselves beginning
to be sick, (for they grew presently desperate, and gave themselves
over without making any resistance) as also their dying
thus like</em> Sheep, <em>infected by mutual visitation: For if men forbore
to visit them for fear, then they died forlorn, whereby many
Families became empty, for want of such as should take care of
them. If they forbore not, then they died themselves, and principally
the honestest men. For out of shame, they would not spare
themselves, but went in unto their friends, especially after it was
come to this pass, that even their Domesticks, wearied with the
lamentations of them that died, and overcome with the greatness
of the calamity, were no longer moved therewith. But those that
were recovered, had much compassion both on them that died, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5p"></a>[p5]</span>
on them that lay sick, as having both known the misery themselvs
and now no more subject to the like danger: For this disease never
took any man the second time so as to be mortal. And these
men were both by others counted happy, and they also themselves,
through excess of present joy, conceived a kind of light hope, never
to die of any other sickness hereafter. Besides the present affliction,
the reception of the Countrey people, and of their substance
into the City, oppressed both them, and much more the people
themselves that so came in. For having no Houses, but dwelling
at that time of the year in stifling Booths, the Mortality was now
without all form; and dying men lay tumbling one upon another
in the Streets, and men half dead about every Conduit through
desire of water. The</em> Temples <em>also where they dwelt in</em> Tents,
<em>were all full of the dead that died within them; for oppressed
with the violence of the Calamity, and not knowing what to do,
Men grew careless, both of</em> Holy <em>and</em> Prophane <em>things alike.
And the Laws which they formerly used touching</em> Funerals, <em>were
all now broken; every one burying where he could find room.
And many for want of things necessary, after so many Deaths before,
were forced to become impudent in the</em> Funerals <em>of their</em>
Friends. <em>For when one had made a</em> Funeral Pile, <em>another getting
before him, would throw on his dead, and give it fire. And
when one was in burning, another would come, and having cast
thereon him whom he carried, go his way again. And the great licentiousness,
which also in other kinds was used in the City, began
at first from this disease. For that which a man before would
dissemble, and not acknowledge to be done for voluptuousness, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6p"></a>[p6]</span>
durst now do freely, seeing before his Eyes such quick revolution,
of the rich dying, and men worth nothing inheriting their Estates;
insomuch as they justified a speedy fruition of their
Goods, even for their pleasure, as Men that thought they held
their Lives but by the day. As for pains, no man was forward in
any action of Honour, to take any, because they thought it uncertain
whether they should die or not, before they atchieved it. But
what any man knew to be delightful, and to be profitable to pleasure,
that was made both profitable <ins class="corr" id="tn-6p" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'and hononourable'">
and honourable</ins>. Neither
the fear of the Gods, nor Laws of men, awed any man. Not the
former, because they concluded it was alike to worship or not worship,
from seeing that alike they all perished: nor the latter, because
no man expected that lives would last, till he received punishment
of his crimes by Judgement. But they thought there
was now over their heads some far greater Judgement decreed
against them; before which fell, they thought to enjoy some
little part of their Lives.</em></p>

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
